# Modern Http Caching

---

## Caching introduction

- public / private cache
- cache proxies
- max age

- Goals: Cost, Freshness, Percieved Performance

-- 

## Response Caching

- put app behind a cdn 

---

## Response Caching - Laravel

```php
Route::middleware('cache.headers:public;max_age=3600')->group(function () {
    Route::get('terms-and-conditions');
    Route::get('about-us');
});
```
--- 

## Response Caching - benefits

- low effort solution for decreased avg response time
- works well if ratio of traffic to number of urls is high
- when content changes infrequently, or freshness is less important a high max age can be set

---

## Response Caching - Limitations

- high frequency urls have high utilisation 
- less frequented urls have low cache utilisation (eg. /flip-flop-warmers?color=red&page=10)
- if requests are distributed across many urls, avg response can be bad
- 99th percentile response time is still really bad
- not suitable when data needs to be fresh

---

## Response Caching - Stale while revalidate 

```php
Route::middleware('cache.headers:public;max_age=600;stale-while-revalidate=3600')->group(function () {
    Route::get('new-products');
});
```

- lower max age
- high cache utilisation
- fresh data

---

## Response Caching - more limitations

- we still get many cache misses
- this doesn't speed up our cold responses
- if a user has to login we must use a private cache header

--- 

## Micro services

- we've been breaking our domain over the last year and a half
- a pattern natually emerged where services sorted themselves into core and edge services
- edge services are user facing 
- aggregate data from multiple core apis and have no database of their own

--- 

## Micro services - store example

#### Core apis
inventory
recommendations
orders

#### Edge services
storefront
landing pages
marketing services

---

## Micro services - Core api

```php
class RecommendationsController
{
    public function __invoke($productId)
    {
        $this->middleware('cache.headers:public;max-age=600;stale-while-revalidate=86400');
        return RecommendedProduct::collection(
            Recommendation::forProduct(productId)
        );
    }
}

```

## Micro services - cache middleware

## Micro services - using cache middleware with http facade

```php

public function register()
{
    $this
        ->app
        ->bind('mystoreClient', function () {
            return Http::withToken()
                ->withMiddleware(new CacheMiddleware(
                    new PublicCacheStrategy(
                        new LaravelCacheStorage(Cache::store('redis'))
                    )
                ));
        });

    $this->app->when(ProductController::class)
        ->needs(PendingRequest::class)
        ->give('mystoreClient');
}

```


```php

class ProductController
{

    private PendingRequest $client;

    public function __construct(PendingRequest $client)
    {
        $this->client = $client;
    }

    public function index($productId)
    {
        [$product, $recommendations, $cart] = $this->client->pool(fn (Pool $pool) => [
            $pool->get("https://products.mystore.com/$productId"),
            $pool->get("https://recommendations.mystore.com/$productId"),
            $pool->get("https://orders.mystore.com/carts/".session('cart-id')),
        ]);

        return Inertia::render('Products/Show', [
            'products' => $products->json(),
            'recommendations' => $recommendations->json(),
            'cart' => $cart->json(),
        ]);
    }
}

```
